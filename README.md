For now, Windows is the only supported platform.

## Getting Started

Download or clone the projects.
If Phyton is installed either SetupEditor.bat or SetupRuntime.bat can be run.
> **NOTE: Runtime isn't implemented yet.**
If Phyton isn't installed, or it didn't work for other reasons, run `scripts/Generate.bat`
